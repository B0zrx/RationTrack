## Problem Overview

Public Distribution System (PDS) plays a vital role in ensuring food security for millions.

However, current systems primarily focus on stock dispatch and transaction records, without verifying whether ration actually reaches the intended beneficiaries.

### Key Gaps Identified
- Lack of visibility into shop-level distribution anomalies
- Dependency on complaints rather than prevention
- No mechanism to correlate stock movement with actual delivery

These gaps result in leakage, diversion, and denial of rations to citizens.
