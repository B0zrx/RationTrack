## System Workflow

1. Stock allocation and transaction data are recorded through existing systems.
2. RationTrack continuously evaluates distribution patterns using rule-based logic.
3. When risk crosses a defined threshold, a reason survey is triggered for the shopkeeper.
4. Citizen confirmation (where available) and behavioral continuity analysis strengthen validation.
5. Risk scores and insights are shown on a government dashboard for proactive action.

The workflow is designed to be scalable, non-intrusive, and policy-aligned.
