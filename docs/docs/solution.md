## Solution Overview – RationTrack

RationTrack is a government-side monitoring and intelligence system designed to improve transparency and accountability in PDS operations.

The system does not replace existing ERP or POS infrastructure. Instead, it acts as a verification and early-warning layer.

### Core Capabilities
- Cross-verifies expected stock vs distributed stock at shop level
- Detects abnormal depletion and mismatch patterns
- Triggers reason surveys only when risk thresholds are breached
- Provides actionable insights to authorities before ration denial occurs

RationTrack focuses on prevention, not post-complaint resolution.
