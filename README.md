# RationTrack

RationTrack is a concept-level system designed to improve transparency and accountability in the Public Distribution System (PDS).

The platform focuses on identifying distribution risks early by analysing stock movement, transaction records, and beneficiary behavior patterns — helping authorities act *before* ration denial occurs.

> This repository represents the system design and workflow overview developed as part of an ideathon.  
> Implementation details are intentionally abstracted.

## Problem Context

Public Distribution Systems often face:
- Stock leakage and diversion
- Lack of visibility at fair price shop level
- Delayed action due to complaint-based monitoring

RationTrack addresses these gaps through structured data verification and risk-based monitoring.

---

## Key Objectives

- Monitor ration distribution integrity
- Detect anomalies using data patterns
- Enable early administrative intervention
- Reduce dependency on manual complaints

---

## Tech Stack (Proposed)

- Backend: Node.js / Python (REST-based)
- Database: Relational DB (PostgreSQL / MySQL)
- Messaging: SMS / IVR (conceptual)
- Dashboard: Web-based UI (React)
