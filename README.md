### 📦 What is RationTrack?
RationTrack is designed to enhance transparency and accountability in the Public Distribution System (PDS).

### 📜 Problem Context
Public Distribution Systems face several challenges:
- **Stock leakage and diversion:** Goods may not reach their intended recipients.
- **Lack of visibility:** Fair price shops need better tracking.

- **Monitor ration distribution integrity:** Ensure that all distributions are legitimate.

- **Reduce dependency on manual complaints:** Streamline monitoring through technology.

### 🖥️ Tech Stack (Proposed)
